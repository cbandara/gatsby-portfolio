          I am a full stack web developer with experience building RESTful API's, web applications
          and mobile applications. My main stack consists of Mongo,
          Express, React and Node but I am very adaptive and pick up stacks quickly. On top of MERN, I am
          working with Nest.js, PostgreSQL, Ionic.js, React Native, Firebase, GCP, AWS, Docker and many other
          leading edge frameworks and libraries.
